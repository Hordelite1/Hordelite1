Being a philanthropist is a passionte thing.
The Almighty God created human beings you and me to one and solve problems confronting other features and humanity.
Our sole responsibility is to find solutions to these problems. 
If my character can not provide any solution to the world, then I must consider myself another kind of problem.
So must you also consider yourself.
Currently, my focus is to give the hopeless people hope with my wisdom: knowledge and experience.
Where there is a need for materials, I cooperate with others to provide.
My motto is "Humanity Before Prosperity".
I'm looking to cooperate with like minded people to create a foundation and a non-profit organization that will help create more job opportunities in my nation.
I have currently many plans to establish an organization that can accommodate more than one million people and give them work.
